# NorthBot
_This project is being abandoned and being rewritten in javascript so that it can interface with a website better. 
If you have any questions I am still going to answer just not as much._     


Self-made discord bot, **in python**, for my personal discord server! 
You are welcome to add the bot to your own discord server if you'd like. 
If you have questions or concerns you can submit issues and requests on the github page for the bot.
